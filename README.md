This repository provides a predictive model of the [condition monitoring of hydraulic systems data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Condition+monitoring+of+hydraulic+systems). The model uses the method of [principle component analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) to extract features that are fed to a [multilayer perceptron (MLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) algorithm. 
The model predicts system condition with an accuracy of 96.17%
